Last Saturday the 9th edition of NodeSchool Łódź took place. This time, the main topic was very trendy and concerned React Native. The workshops were led by [Bartosz](https://twitter.com/btmpl) with support of [Mateusz](https://twitter.com/pokorson). This was the 4th meeting that I organized.

> NodeSchool is an open project of free workshops organized to help people learn Node.js and web software skills. It is aimed both for programmers who know nothing about Node.js and for Node.js programmers who want to learn new things. Source: https://nodeschool.io/lodz/

The ticket distribution process set a new record. All of the tickets were gone within twelve hours!

What's especially rewarding is that the event became receiving great recognition from the local IT companies. As previously, we met at the new office of [Comarch](http://www.comarch.pl/). In addition to this, we've been supported by [BinarApps](https://binarapps.com/) and [4developers Łódź](https://lodz.4developers.org.pl) who sposored rewards for the participants.
