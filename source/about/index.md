# Hello and welcome to my blog!

{% img about-photo /about/photo.jpg 200 Krzysztof Zbiciński - Author %}

My name is Krzysztof and I'm a web developer, currently living in a beautiful city of Łódź, Poland. I am the organizer of [local NodeSchool workshops](https://nodeschool.io/lodz).

I like applying reasonable approaches to software development, especially in the ever-changing world of JavaScript. Hence the previous tagline of the blog - *How to code frontend and don't go bonkers*.

In my spare time I like watching sports, reading books and occasionally cooking something super-healthy.
