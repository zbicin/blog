# ngh - you want to know this command 

Back in the days there was a command in the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) named `ng ghpages`. It was intended to provide a trival way of publishing the application generated with `ng`. It was building the project, grabbing the contents of the `dist` directory and pushing them to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository. Then, the application was available online at `<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPOSITORY NAME>`.

Because of unknown reasons (ok, [not so uknown](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pull/4385#issuecomment-280979569)) it got removed from the Angular CLI:

@gkucmierz there were many reported issues with this command, so rather than ship the CLI with the issues it was decided to remove it, especially with some viable community alternatives.

The void was quickly filled with new tools that were performing the same task. One that is especially worth recommending is [angular-cli-ghpages](https://github.com/angular-buch/angular-cli-ghpages). I use it in my Go home, JS project and it works flawlessly. You can check it out yourself by visiting [http://zbic.in/go-home-js](http://zbic.in/go-home-js).

What I would consider a good practice is creating an npm script that calls `ngh` with all required parameters. You can go [through all of the options](https://github.com/angular-buch/angular-cli-ghpages#options) yourself, to see what opportunities it gives. As a quick tl;dr example, a fragment of my `package.json` looks as follows:

```javascript package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "ghpages": "ngh --no-silent --name=\"Krzysztof Zbici≈Ñski\" --email=\"<MY GITHUB EMAIL>\"",
  },
  //...
}
```
