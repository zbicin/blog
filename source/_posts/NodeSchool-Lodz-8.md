On the last Saturday the 8th edition of [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io) took place in Łódź, which considered fundamentals of the React library. The workshops were led by [Mateusz](https://twitter.com/pokorson) with support of [Bartosz](https://twitter.com/btmpl) (who gave a great presentation about most common beginner mistakes) and Piotr. It was the third time I had pleasure of organizing this meeting.

> NodeSchool is an open project of free workshops organized to help people learn Node.js and web software skills. It is aimed both for programmers who know nothing about Node.js and for Node.js programmers who want to learn new things. Source: https://nodeschool.io/lodz/

What's especially rewarding is that the event became receiving great recognition from the local IT companies. As previously we met at the new office of [Comarch](http://www.comarch.pl/). In addition to this, we've been supported by [BinarApps](https://binarapps.com/) and [4developers Łódź](https://lodz.4developers.org.pl) who sposored rewards for the participants.
