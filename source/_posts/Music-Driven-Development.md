Back in the days, I tweeted few words about staying focused:

After a year, I can broaden this statement and say that what gives me really great focus is *music in general*.

Recently I've had to go through a tedious task of writing my master thesis. The vision of performing a long research and dedicating an infinite amount of hours to it was anything but motivating. Nevertheless I had to put myself together and eventually face the challenge.

The surprising game changer was listening to VNM's album entitled [Halflajf](https://open.spotify.com/album/5oAuwOiJkJDMKFLSraNkAX) In addition to regular breaks (whether performed according to the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) or not) it was the major factor that was driving my productivity.

The good thing about listening to an album is that you can set a pause after a particular song and/or after the whole album has been played. That way it is easier to remember about taking breaks, even if the keyboard is on fire and _you want only to add this one more feature and then you'll definately take a break_. Most of the time *I didn't*. I simply kept forgetting about it.

Interestingly, I discovered that I have a set of music albums or Spotify playlists that I can listen to during literally the whole workday and don't get bored. They include e.g. chillstep and latino music playlists as well as some albums from Kanye West (especially [The College Dropout](https://open.spotify.com/album/1NRRN5RWwfuLmQdjshz0L7)!), Limp Bizkit or Bob Marley. I haven't determined what is their common part though. It's not the genre nor the language, that's for sure.

Well... it's seems that I'm a pioneer of the music driven development. ;)
