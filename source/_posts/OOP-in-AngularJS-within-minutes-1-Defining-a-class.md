# OOP in AngularJS within minutes - #1 Defining a class

When it comes to object oriented programming, JavaScript is a little bit weird in comparison with other (preferably C-like) languages. The same holds true while working with AngularJS.

The topic has been already covered in the Internet multiple times. If you're looking for a comprehensive article, just google it up. This blog post is intended to be used more like a handnote or a cheatsheet, so I'll try to keep it extremally concise.

The following example represents a `Task` class which contains two properties: a textual content and a (theoretically) read-only array of hashtags. The latter property is automatically regenerated by extracting hashtags from the task's content via a regex expression.

Long story short, defining a class in AngularJS looks as follows:

```javascript task.factory.js
myApp.factory('Task', function () {
    // defining a constructor
    function Task(content) {
        // initialization of the object happens here
        this.setContent(content);
    }

    // defining public members
    Task.prototype = {
        setContent: function (value) {
        this._content = value;

        //looking for hashtags
        var regexp = /\B\#\w\w+\b/g;
        this._tags = this._content.match(regexp);
        },
        getContent: function () {
        return this._content;
        },
        getTags: function () {
        return this._tags;
        }
    };

    // defining a static method
    Task.restore = function (data) {
        return new Task(data._content);
    };

    return Task;
});
```

There is no way to define a purely private property (or at least I don't know one). In my opinion, the best that can be done is to follow a specific naming convention. Names of properties that are not intended to be directly modified should start with an underscore character (`_content`) and be accompanied by  appropriate getters and setters.

To become usable in a controller, the class has to be injected as any other module and we're done:

```javascript main.controller.js
myApp.controller('MainController', ['$scope', 'Task', function ($scope, Task) {
    $scope.task = new Task('Lorem lipsum #hashtag');
    $scope.anotherOne = Task.restore({ _content: 'Another one'});
}]);
```
